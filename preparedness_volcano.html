                            <p class="py-3 page-text-1">A volcano is an opening, or rupture, in the surface or crust of the Earth or a planetary mass object, which allows hot lava, volcanic ash and gases to escape from the magma chamber below the surface. On Earth, volcanoes are generally found where tectonic plates are diverging or converging. A mid-oceanic ridge, for example the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, has examples of volcanoes caused by divergent tectonic plates pulling apart; the Pacific Ring of Fire has examples of volcanoes caused by convergent tectonic plates coming together.  Volcanoes are not usually created where two tectonic plates slide past one another. Volcanoes can also form where there is stretching and thinning of the Earth's crust in the interiors of plates. Erupting volcanoes can pose many hazards, not only in the immediate vicinity of the eruption. Volcanic ash can be a threat to aircraft, in particular those with jet engines where ash particles can be melted by the high operating temperature; the melted particles then adhere to the turbine blades and alter their shape, disrupting the operation of the turbine. Large eruptions can affect temperature as ash and droplets of sulfuric acid obscure the sun and cool the Earth's lower atmosphere or troposphere; however, they also absorb heat radiated up from the Earth, thereby warming the stratosphere. Historically, so-called volcanic winters have caused catastrophic famines.  </p>

                                          Put goggles and disposable breathing masks for each family member in your disaster supply kit. Stay away from active volcano sites. If you live near a known volcano, active or dormant, learn about your community warning systems and emergency plans, and be ready to evacuate at a moment's notice. Reinforce existing building structures and build protective works such as dikes to deflect lava and lava flow. Be prepared either to shelter or to evacuate.  Plan an evacuation route, taking the highest ground to escape the effects of the eruption.  Have a backup route planned as well. Be ready to evacuate at a moment’s notice.  Leave the area at the first sign of a volcanic eruption.  If you have time, close windows and doors to prevent debris and fumes from getting inside. Put your car in the garage, where it is most likely to stay safe.  Remain inside your house with your windows and doors closed, if you do not have time to evacuate.  Determine how you will contact your family if separated during an evacuation.   If you have a disability or need assistance, make contact with your support network and keep informed of civil defense advice. Put all machinery inside a garage or shed, or cover with large tarpaulins to protect them from volcanic ash. Bring animals and livestock into closed shelters to protect them from volcanic ash. Protect sensitive electronics and do not uncover until the environment is totally ash-free.  Check on friends and neighbors who may require special assistance.

                                          Follow the evacuation order issued by authorities and evacuate immediately from the volcano area to avoid flying debris, hot gases, lateral blast and lava flow. Be aware of mudflows. The danger from a mudflow increases near stream channels and with prolonged heavy rains. Mudflows can move faster than you can walk or run. Look upstream before crossing a bridge and do not cross the bridge if a mudflow is approaching. Avoid river valleys and low-lying areas. Remember to help your neighbors who may require special assistance - infants, elderly people and people with access and functional needs. If you are unable to evacuate, and in order to protect yourself from falling ash, you should remain indoors with doors, windows and ventilation closed until the ash settles. If you have a respiratory ailment, avoid contact with any amount of ash. Stay indoors until local health officials advise it is safe to go outside. Listen to a battery-powered radio or television for the latest emergency information. Wear long-sleeved shirts and long pants. Use goggles and wear eyeglasses instead of contact lenses. Use a dust mask or hold a damp cloth over your face to help with breathing. Stay away from areas downwind from the volcano to avoid volcanic ash. Stay indoors until the ash has settled unless there is a danger of the roof collapsing. Close doors, windows, and all ventilation in the house (chimney vents, furnaces, air conditioners, fans and other vents. Clear heavy ash from flat or low-pitched roofs and rain gutters. Avoid running car or truck engines. Driving can stir up volcanic ash that can clog engines, damage moving parts, and stall vehicles. Avoid driving in heavy ash fall unless absolutely required. If you have to drive, keep speed down to 35 MPH or slower.

                                        Pay attention to warnings, and obey instructions from local authorities. For example, stay indoors until local health officials tell you it is safe to go outside. Listen to local news updates for information about air quality, drinking water, and roads. Turn off all heating and air conditioning units and fans, and close windows, doors, and fireplace and woodstove dampers to help keep ash and gases from getting into your house. Exposure to ash can harm your health, particularly the respiratory (breathing) tract. To protect yourself while you are outdoors or while you are cleaning up ash that has gotten indoors, a disposable particulate respirator (also known as an “air purifying respirator”) may be considered. An N-95 respirator is the most common type of disposable particulate respirator and can be purchased at hardware stores. It is important to follow directions for proper use of this respirator. For more information, see NIOSH-Approved Disposable Particulate Respirators (Filtering Face pieces) . If you don’t have a disposable particulate respirator, you can protect yourself by using a nuisance dust mask as a last resort, but you should stay outdoors for only short periods while dust is falling. Nuisance dust masks can provide comfort and relief from exposure to relatively non-hazardous contaminants such as pollen, but they do not offer as much protection as a particulate respirator. Note that disposable particulate respirators do not filter toxic gases and vapors. Stay away from ash fall areas, if possible. Avoid contact with ash as much as you can. Keep your skin covered to avoid irritation from contact with ash. Wear goggles to protect your eyes from ash. Do not travel unless you have to. Driving in ash is hazardous to your health and your car. Driving will stir up more ash that can clog engines and stall vehicles. Replace disposable furnace filters or clean permanent furnace filters frequently. If your drinking water has ash in it, use another source of drinking water, such as purchased bottled water, until your water can be tested.
Clear roofs of ash, which is very heavy and can cause buildings to collapse. Be very cautious when working on a roof. Ash can be slippery and make it easy to fall.
